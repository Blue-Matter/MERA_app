  title: Methods Evaluation and Risk Assessment

  port: 8080 # use Port 8080 for ShinyProxy
  
  container-wait-time: 30000 # how long should we wait for the container to spin up (30s as default as this is enough for our Shiny apps)
  heartbeat-rate: 10000 # the user's browser will send a heartbeat call every heartbeat-rate milliseconds (10s as default)
  heartbeat-timeout: 60000 # if the server does not receive a heartbeat for heartbeat-timeout milliseconds, the relevant proxy will be released (60s as default)

  #### Set Up Usage Statistics Monitoring
  usage-stats-url: http://influxdb:8086/write?db=shinyproxy_usagestats # use InfluxDB to store usage statistics; can be in a different server
  # usage-stats-username: xxxx # influxdb username if needed
  # usage-stats-password: xxxx # influxdb password if needed

  #### OpenID Connect Authentication ####
  authentication: openid # use openid auth framework
  openid:
    roles-claim: cognito:groups # use the groups value passed by AWS cognito to identify user groups
    auth-url: https://mera.auth.us-west-2.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/authorize

    client-id: 57gl0olrsqj2cvadrm8i8bju4n # get this from AWS Cognito user pool management page
